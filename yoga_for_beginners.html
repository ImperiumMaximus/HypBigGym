	<strong>YOGA CLASSES:</strong> What is yoga? Yoga is an ancient body of physical, mental, and spiritual practices designed to cultivate inner peace, an open heart, a calm mind, and a strong, flexible, relaxed body. Yoga first began in India 5000 years ago. &ldquo;Yoga&rdquo; in Sanskrit literally means to forge a union between mind and body. Hatha yoga emphasizes the physical aspect of yoga. Ancient hatha yogis recognized that the state of the body affects the mind and the state of the mind affects the body. The postures or asanas practiced in hatha yoga were developed to relax, detoxify, and strengthen the body in preparation for meditation. This type of practice is like meditation-in-movement. Most hatha yoga classes include asanas, pranyama (breathing techniques), deep relaxation, and meditation. At UCLA Recreation, two general yoga forms are practiced: Hatha Yoga and Power Yoga. The basic difference is that Power Yoga is practiced in a &ldquo;flow&rdquo; format. Asanas are linked together, and students flow from one posture to another rather than holding one particular posture or asana for an extended period of time. Hatha classes vary by the instructor teaching and level of the class. Some Hatha (listed as &ldquo;Yoga&rdquo;) classes, however, may be taught in a &ldquo;flow&rdquo; technique. At UCLA Recreation, our classes are designed to provide a challenging and meaningful practice. Yoga, itself, is the best teacher. Start your practice today. Learn to live in the moment.</p>
